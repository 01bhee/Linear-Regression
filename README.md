**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn**

This is a basic implementation of Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn. The goal was to get hands-on experience with applying a machine learning model to real data and visualizing the results.

What I did:

Loaded and prepared data using Pandas and NumPy

Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model

Plotted the regression line alongside the data points using Matplotlib

This project helped me understand how to fit and visualize linear models using Scikit-Learn.
